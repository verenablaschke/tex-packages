# Lettrinebox

Lettrinebox creates a box typeset in [EB Garamond](http://www.georgduffner.at/ebgaramond/index.html), with several of the historical font variants activated.
It mostly acts as a wrapper around the [coloredlettrine](https://github.com/raphink/coloredlettrine) package, which creates a decorated dropped initial in two colours of your choosing.
At the moment, there exist only decorated initials for *A*, *G* anf *T*, so you might need to apply some Oulipian constraints to your writing.
