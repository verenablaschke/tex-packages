\lettrinebox{8cm}{lettrinebox dot sty}{Generates a box typeset in \textit{EB~Garamond}, with several of the historical font variants activated.
It mostly acts as a wrapper around the \textit{coloredlettrine} package, which creates a decorated dropped initial in two colours of your choosing.
At the moment, it only includes decorated initials for \textit{A}, \textit{G} and \textit{T}, so prepare yourself for Oulipian constraints in your writing.
Enjoy!}
