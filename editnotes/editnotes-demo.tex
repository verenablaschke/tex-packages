\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{editnotes}
\begin{document}
\todo{Add an introduction here} lorem ipsum.
\rephrase{Express this differently}.
Test test.
This note doesn't come with a label: \todo*{add more text here}.
Neither does \rephrase*{this one}.
I just used the word \repetition{test} again.
The command \texttt{\textbackslash{}editnotesummary} produces a summary of how many editing notes there are left in your text:
\editnotesummary
