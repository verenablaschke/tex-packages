# Work in progress

A XeLaTeX style file for the memoir class.

Creates a book with A5 pages that are meant to be trimmed to 14 cm x 21 cm (remove 8.5 mm from the foreedge), with margins and page/text block ratios inspired by [the canons of page construction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canons_of_page_construction).

Intended for books with lots of commentary (in the form of margin notes, footnotes and entire pages of commentary).
